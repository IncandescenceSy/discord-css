CSS that removes bloat and ads from Discord. Can be used with the website or any modded client

Sections are commented, so you can easily remove anything you don't like

Anything that uses aria-label will only work in English. If you use another language, you'll have to modify it yourself (just replace the text with whatever it says in your language)

Todo:
- Replace uses of aria-label with language-agnostic counterparts where possible
- Hide top bar
- Settings:
  - Hide Payment Settings header
  - Hide Server Boost tab
- Server:
  - Hide Server Boost tab
